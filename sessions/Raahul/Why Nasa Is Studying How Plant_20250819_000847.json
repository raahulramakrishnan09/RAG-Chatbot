      "content": "NASA is studying how plants grow on the ISS because astronauts need access to healthy foods full of vitamins during their missions.  Packaged foods and supplements need resupplying, which won't be possible for longer missions further into the universe.  Therefore, growing plants in space is being researched to provide a sustainable food source.",

This involves using soaked cotton balls as a plant \"pillow,\" placing seeds on top, and sealing them in a resealable bag to create a mini-greenhouse.  You can then compare your Earth soil samples to a Mars recreation (instructions for which are also provided) to see how they differ and what is similar.  Additionally, you can use this system to test how plants respond to changes in gravity.",
